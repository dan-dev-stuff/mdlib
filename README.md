##A basic wiki using mark down files
This is a proof of concept i've been working on to edit markdown files, a bit like Wikitten but i wanted to be able to add, remove and rename the files.

###NOTE: this is only ment for use on an local server, security is in my to-do list (below)

##To-do:
   * Styling: including responcivity, it's just a prototype so far.
   * Add a file search.
   * Add key bindings (ctrl+s = save etc).
   * Add github gist support (or similar would be nice)
   * Make secure for a production server, writing to the file system and alowing file renaming isn't very safe
   * Refactor for mongodb and mysql
   * Tidy up code, refactor refartor refactor...
